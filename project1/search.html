<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this project, your Pac-Man agent will find paths through his maze world, to reach a particular location and (optionally) to collect food efficiently.  You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pac-Man scenarios. </p>

<p>The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore.

<p>
<p><strong>What to submit:</strong> You will fill in portions of <code><a href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code> and <code><a href="docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</a></code> (optionaly, for extra credits) during the assignment.  You should submit nothing other than these two files.  
</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Your code will be autograded for technical
correctness. Please <em>do not</em> change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's output -- will be the final judge of your score.  

<h3> Welcome to Pac-Man </h3>
After downloading the code (<a href="search.zip">search.zip</a>), unzipping it and changing to the <em>search</em> directory, you should be able to play a game of Pac-Man by typing the following at the command line:

<pre>python pacman.py</pre>

Note: if you get error messages regarding python-tk, use your package manager to install <i>python-tk</i>, or see <a href=http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter>this page</a> for more detailed instructions.

Pac-Man lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty round treats.  Navigating this world efficiently will be Pac-Man's first step in mastering his domain.  

<p> The simplest agent in <a href="docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</a> is called the <code>GoWestAgent</code>, which always goes West (a trivial reflex agent).  This agent can occasionally win:

<pre>python pacman.py --layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</pre>

But, things get ugly for this agent when turning is required:

<pre>python pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</pre>

If pacman gets stuck, you can exit the game by typing CTRL-c into your terminal.

Soon, your agent will solve not only <code>tinyMaze</code>, but any maze you want.

Note that <code><a href="docs/pacman.html">pacman.py</a></code> supports a number of options that can each be expressed in a long way (e.g., <code>--layout</code>) or a short way (e.g., <code>-l</code>).  You can see the list of all options and their default values via:

<pre>python pacman.py -h</pre>

Also, all of the commands that appear in this project also appear in <a href="commands.txt">commands.txt</a>, for easy copying and pasting.  In UNIX/Mac OS X, you can even run all these commands in order with <code>bash commands.txt</code>.

<h3> Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Search Algorithms </h3>

In <code><a href="docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</a></code>, you'll find a fully implemented <code>SearchAgent</code>, which plans out a path through Pac-Man's world and then executes that path step-by-step.  The search algorithms for formulating a plan are not implemented -- that's your job.  As you work through the following questions, you might need to refer to this <a href="#Glossary">glossary of objects in the code</a>.

First, test that the <code>SearchAgent</code> is working correctly by running:

<pre>python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch</pre>

The command above tells the <code>SearchAgent</code> to use <code>tinyMazeSearch</code> as its search algorithm, which is implemented in <code><a href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code>.  Pac-Man should navigate the maze successfully.

<p>Now it's time to write full-fledged generic search functions to help Pac-Man plan routes! Pseudocode for the search algorithms you'll write can be found in the lecture slides and textbook. I have already defined a node data type that contains not only a state but also the information necessary to reconstruct the path (plan) which gets to that state.  

<p><em>Important note:</em> All of your search functions need to return a list of <em>actions</em> that will lead the agent from the start to the goal.  These actions all have to be legal moves (valid directions, no moving through walls).

<p><em>Hint:</em> Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* differ only in the details of how the fringe is managed.  So, concentrate on getting DFS right and the rest should be relatively straightforward.  Indeed, one possible implementation requires only a single generic search method which is configured with an algorithm-specific queuing strategy.  (Your implementation need <em>not</em> be of this form to receive full credit). 

<p><em>Hint:</em> Make sure to check out the <code>Stack, Queue</code> and <code>PriorityQueue</code> types provided to you in <code><a href="docs/util.html">util.py</a></code>!  </p>

<p><em><strong>Question 1 (10 points) </strong></em> Implement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in the
<code>depthFirstSearch</code> function in <code><a href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code>. To make your algorithm <em>complete</em>, write the graph search version of DFS, which avoids expanding any already visited states (textbook section 3.5). 

<p>Your code should quickly find a solution for:

<pre>python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent</pre>

<pre>python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent</pre>

<pre>python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent</pre>

The Pac-Man board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration).  Is the exploration order what you would have expected?  Does Pac-Man actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?  

<p> <em>Hint:</em> If you use a <code>Stack</code> as your data structure, the solution found by your DFS algorithm for <code>mediumMaze</code> should have a length of 130 (provided you push successors onto the fringe in the order provided by getSuccessors; you might get 244 if you push them in the reverse order). Is this a least cost solution? If not, think about what depth-first search is doing wrong.

<p><em><strong>Question 2 (10 point) </strong></em> Implement the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in the
<code>breadthFirstSearch</code> function in <code><a href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code>. Again, write a graph search algorithm that avoids expanding any already visited states. Test your code the same way you did for depth-first search.

<pre>python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs</pre>

<pre>python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5</pre>

Does BFS find a least cost solution?   If not, check your implementation.

<p> <em>Hint:</em> If Pac-Man moves too slowly for you, try the option <code>--frameTime 0</code>.

<p> <em>Note:</em> If you've written your search code generically, your code should work equally well for the eight-puzzle search problem (textbook section 3.2) without any changes.  

<pre>python eightpuzzle.py</pre>

<h3> A* search </h3>

<p><em><strong> Question 3 (20 points)  </strong></em> Implement A* graph search in the empty function <code>aStarSearch</code> in <code><a href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code>. A* takes a heuristic function as an argument.  Heuristics  take two arguments: a state in the search problem (the main argument), and the problem itself (for reference information).  The <code>nullHeuristic</code> heuristic function in <code><a href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code> is a trivial example. 

<p>You can test your A* implementation on the original problem of finding a path through a maze to a fixed position using the Manhattan distance heuristic (implemented already as <code>manhattanHeuristic</code> in <code><a href="docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</a></code>). 

<pre>python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic </pre>

If you run A* with <code>nullHeuristic</code> then you get uniform cost search.
You should see that A* finds the optimal solution slightly faster than uniform cost search (about 549 vs. 620 search nodes expanded in our implementation, but ties in priority may make your numbers differ slightly).  What happens on <code>openMaze</code> for the various search strategies?
    
<h3> Eating All The Dots (Extra Credits)</h3>

Now we'll solve a hard search problem: eating all the Pac-Man food in as few steps as possible.  For this, we'll need a new search problem definition which formalizes the food-clearing problem: <code>FoodSearchProblem</code> in <code><a href="docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</a></code> (implemented for you).  A solution is defined to be a path that collects all of the food in the Pac-Man world.  For the present project, solutions do not take into account any ghosts or power pellets; solutions only depend on the placement of walls, regular food and Pac-Man.  (Of course ghosts can ruin the execution of a solution!  We'll get to that in the next project.)  If you have written your general search methods correctly, <code>A*</code> with a null heuristic (equivalent to uniform-cost search) should quickly find an optimal solution to <a href="layouts/testSearch.lay">testSearch</a> with no code change on your part (total cost of 7).

<pre>python pacman.py -l testSearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent</pre>

<p> <em>Note:</em> <code>AStarFoodSearchAgent</code> is a shortcut for <code>-p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,prob=FoodSearchProblem,heuristic=foodHeuristic</code>.

<p>You should find that UCS starts to slow down even for the seemingly simple <code><a href="layouts/tinySearch.lay">tinySearch</a></code>. It should find a path of length 27 after expanding 4902 search nodes. 

<p> <em><strong> Question 4 (5 points)  </strong></em> Fill in <code>foodHeuristic</code> in <code><a href="docs/searchAgents.html">searchAgents.py</a></code> with a <emph> consistent </emph> heuristic for the <code>FoodSearchProblem</code>.  Try your agent on the <code>trickySearch</code> board:

<pre>python pacman.py -l trickySearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent</pre>

UCS agent (A* with h=0) explores over 16,000 nodes.  If your heuristic is admissible, you will receive the following score, depending on how many nodes your heuristic expands.    

<table align="center" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr><th>Fewer nodes than:</th><th>Points</th></tr>
    <tr><td>15000</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>12000</td><td>2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10000</td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9000</td><td>4 (medium)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7000</td><td>5 (hard)</td></tr>
</table>

<p> If your heuristic is inadmissible, you will receive <em>no</em> credit, so be careful!  Think through admissibility carefully, as inadmissible heuristics may manage to produce fast searches and even optimal paths.  

<h3> <a name="Glossary">Object Glossary</a> </h3>

<p> Here's a glossary of the key objects in the code base related to search problems, for your reference:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>SearchProblem (search.py)</code></dt>
      <dd>A SearchProblem is an abstract object that represents the state space, successor function, costs, and goal state of a problem.  You will interact with any SearchProblem only through the methods defined at the top of <code><a href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code></dd>
      <dt><code>PositionSearchProblem (searchAgents.py)</code></dt>
      <dd>A specific type of SearchProblem that you will be working with --- it corresponds to searching for a single pellet in a maze.  </dd>
      <dt><code>CornersProblem (searchAgents.py)</code></dt>
      <dd>A specific type of SearchProblem that you will define --- it corresponds to searching for a path through all four corners of a maze.  </dd>
      <dt><code>FoodSearchProblem (searchAgents.py)</code></dt>
      <dd>A specific type of SearchProblem that you will be working with --- it corresponds to searching for a way to eat all the pellets in a maze.  </dd>
      <dt>Search Function</dt>
      <dd>A search function is a function which takes an instance of SearchProblem as a parameter, runs some algorithm, and returns a sequence of actions that lead to a goal.  Example of search functions are <code>depthFirstSearch</code> and <code>breadthFirstSearch</code>, which you have to write.  You are provided <code>tinyMazeSearch</code> which is a very bad search function that only works correctly on <code>tinyMaze</code>
      <dt><code>SearchAgent</code></dt>
      <dd><code>SearchAgent</code> is is a class which implements an Agent (an object that interacts with the world) and does its planning through a search function.  The <code>SearchAgent</code> first uses the search function provided to make a plan of actions to take to reach the goal state, and then executes the actions one at a time.</dd>
