<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pac-Man, including ghosts.  Along the way, you will implement both minimax and alpha-beta minimax search, as well as expectimax search.

<p>The code base has not changed much from the previous project, but please start with a fresh installation, rather than intermingling files from project 1. 

<p>The code for this project contains the following files, available as a <a href="../ma_searchProj.zip">zip
archive</a>.

<p><strong>What to submit:</strong> You will fill in portions of <code><a href="docs/multiAgents.html">multiAgents.py</a></code>
during the assignment. You should submit <em>only</em> this file with your code and comments.


<p><strong>Warning:</strong> DO NOT import anything. Your code must not depend on any library not already included. Also <em>do not</em> change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Multi-Agent Pac-Man</h3>
<p>First, play a game of classic Pac-Man:

<pre>python pacman.py</pre>

Now, run the provided <code>ReflexAgent</code> in <code><a href="docs/multiAgents.html">multiAgents.py</a></code>:

<pre>python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent</pre>

Note that it plays quite poorly even on simple layouts:

<pre>python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l testClassic</pre>

Inspect its code (in <code><a href="docs/multiAgents.html">multiAgents.py</a></code>) and make sure you understand what it's doing.



<p><em><strong>Question 1 (10 points) </strong></em>: The above <code>ReflexAgent</code> gives you some helpful examples of methods that you may need to use. Now you will write an adversarial search agent in the provided <code>MinimaxAgent</code> class stub in <code><a href="docs/multiAgents.html">multiAgents.py</a></code>.  Your minimax agent should work with any number of ghosts, so you'll have to write an algorithm that is slightly more general than what appears in the textbook.    
In particular, your minimax tree will have multiple min layers (one for each ghost) for every max layer. </p>

<p> Your code should also expand the game tree to an arbitrary depth. Score the leaves of your minimax tree with the supplied <code>self.evaluationFunction</code>, which defaults to <code>scoreEvaluationFunction</code>. 
 <code>MinimaxAgent</code> extends <code>MultiAgentAgent</code>, which gives access to <code>self.depth</code> and <code>self.evaluationFunction</code>.  Make sure your minimax code makes reference to these two variables where appropriate as these variables are populated in response to command line options.  

<p><em>Important:</em> A single search ply is considered to be one Pac-Man move and all the ghosts' responses, so depth 2 search will involve Pac-Man and each ghost moving two times. Your code must also print the value of the action that getAction returns (i.e., the value of the minimax decision)</p>


<p><em><strong>Hints and Observations</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>The evaluation function in this part is already written (<code>self.evaluationFunction</code>).  You shouldn't change this function, but recognize that now we're evaluating *states* rather than actions, as we were for the reflex agent.  Look-ahead agents evaluate future states whereas reflex agents evaluate actions from the current state.</li>
<li>The minimax values of the initial state in the <code>minimaxClassic</code> layout are 9, 8, 7, -492 for depths 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.  Note that your minimax agent will often win (665/1000 games for us) despite the dire prediction of depth 4 minimax.

<pre>python pacman.py -p MinimaxAgent -l minimaxClassic -a depth=4</pre>

<li>To increase the search depth achievable by your agent, remove the <code>Directions.STOP</code> action from Pac-Man's list of possible actions.  Depth 2 should be pretty quick, but depth 3 or 4 will be slow.  Don't worry, the next question will speed up the search somewhat.

<li>Pac-Man is always agent 0, and the agents move in order of increasing agent index.  

<li>All states in minimax should be <code>GameStates</code>, either passed in to <code>getAction</code> or generated via <code>GameState.generateSuccessor</code>.

<li>On larger boards such as <code>openClassic</code> and <code>mediumClassic</code> (the default), you'll find Pac-Man to be good at not dying, but quite bad at winning.  He'll often thrash around without making progress.  He might even thrash around right next to a dot without eating it because he doesn't know where he'd go after eating that dot.  Don't worry if you see this behavior.

<li>When Pac-Man believes that his death is unavoidable, he will try to end the game as soon as possible because of the constant penalty for living.  Sometimes, this is the wrong thing to do with random ghosts, but minimax agents always assume the worst:

<pre>python pacman.py -p MinimaxAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3</pre>

Make sure you understand why Pac-Man rushes the closest ghost in this case.

</ul>

<p><em><strong>Question 2 (10 points) </strong></em>: Make a new agent that uses alpha-beta pruning to more efficiently explore the minimax tree, in <code>AlphaBetaAgent</code>.  Again, your algorithm will be slightly more general than the pseudo-code in the textbook, so part of the challenge is to extend the alpha-beta pruning logic appropriately to multiple minimizer agents.  

<p> You should see a speed-up (perhaps depth 3 alpha-beta will run as fast as depth 2 minimax).  Ideally, depth 3 on <code>smallClassic</code> should run in just a few seconds per move or faster.  

<pre>python pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -a depth=3 -l smallClassic</pre>

<p> The <code>AlphaBetaAgent</code> minimax values should be identical to the <code>MinimaxAgent</code> minimax values, although the actions it selects can vary because of different tie-breaking behavior.  Again, the minimax values of the initial state in the <code>minimaxClassic</code> layout are 9, 8, 7 and -492 for depths 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.  

<p><em><strong>Question 3 (5 points) </strong></em>
Random ghosts are of course not optimal minimax agents, and so modeling them with minimax search may not be appropriate.  Fill in <code>ExpectimaxAgent</code>, where your agent
agent will no longer take the min over all ghost actions, but the expectation according to your agent's model of how the ghosts
act.  To simplify your code, assume you will only be running against <code>RandomGhost</code> ghosts, which choose amongst their
<code>getLegalAction</code>s uniformly at random.

<p>You should now observe a more cavalier approach in close quarters with ghosts.  In particular, if Pac-Man perceives that he could be trapped but might escape to grab a few more pieces of food, he'll at least try.  Investigate the results of these two scenarios:

<pre>python pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3 -q -n 10</pre>

<pre>python pacman.py -p ExpectimaxAgent -l trappedClassic -a depth=3 -q -n 10</pre>

You should find that your <code>ExpectimaxAgent</code> wins about half the time, while your <code>AlphaBetaAgent</code> always loses.  Make sure you understand why the behavior here differs from the minimax case.
